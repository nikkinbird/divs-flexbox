            <main>
                <p>I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who loves to bring my creativity and imagination to every project. I create Wordpress sites to help creatives showcase their work. When I'm not learning more about web development, I can be found knitting and spinning, growing new plants in my garden, or hiking along Lake Superior with my family and our husky Millie.</p>

                My favorite genre of novel is fantasy. The stories I love the most are ones where the protagonist fights against the odds for what's right. I also really love mystery novels with fantasy settings. My favorite author is Tamora Pierce, and my favorite books of hers are the Beka Cooper series.

                If I could do anything, I would have a farm with sheep and alpacas. I wouldn't mind some chickens, ducks, and goats either. Honestly, I could totally see myself ending up with a sanctuary for animals that need a home.

                I am constantly learning new things, whether it's in coding, fiber arts, or reading and writing. Each new thing leads me to another. From spinning yarn on my spindle, I was led to foraging for natural dye material and planting a dye garden. I've always got something to do!
